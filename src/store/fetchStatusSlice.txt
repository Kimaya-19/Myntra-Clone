Technical Description of fetchStatusSlice.js
This file defines a Redux slice using the @reduxjs/toolkit library, specifically for managing the fetching status of asynchronous operations in a React application. Here's a breakdown of how the code works and its technical details:

Slice Creation:

The createSlice function is imported from @reduxjs/toolkit. It simplifies the process of creating Redux slices by automatically generating action creators and action types.
A slice named fetchStatus is created with the following properties:
name: The name of the slice, which is 'fetchStatus'.
initialState: The initial state is an object with two properties:
fetchDone: A boolean that indicates whether the fetch operation is complete (default is false).
loading: A boolean that indicates if the data is currently being loaded (default is false).
Reducers:

The slice contains three reducers, which are functions that handle state changes:
markFetchingStarted: Sets the loading state to true, indicating that a fetch operation has started.
markFetchDone: Sets the fetchDone state to true, indicating that the fetch operation has completed.
markFetchingFinished: Sets the loading state to false, indicating that the fetch operation is finished.
Direct State Modification:

Thanks to the Immer library integrated with Redux Toolkit, the reducers can mutate the state directly without needing to return a new state object. This makes the code more concise and readable.
Exporting Actions and Reducer:

The generated action creators are exported as fetchStatusActions, allowing other parts of the application to dispatch these actions.
The slice's reducer is exported as the default export, which can be integrated into the Redux store.
Summary
In summary, fetchStatusSlice.js provides a simple and efficient way to manage the fetching status of asynchronous operations within a Redux store. It maintains the loading state and fetch completion status, enabling the application to provide feedback to users during data-fetching processes. This approach enhances the user experience by allowing for clear state management and responsiveness in the UI.
