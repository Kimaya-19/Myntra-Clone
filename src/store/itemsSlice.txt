This file defines a Redux slice for managing a collection of items in a state management system using Redux Toolkit. Here’s a breakdown of its components and functionalities:

Imports:

createSlice from @reduxjs/toolkit: This utility function simplifies the process of creating Redux slices, which include reducers and actions.
DEFAULT_ITEMS: This is an array of default item objects imported from a local data file, which serves as the initial state for the slice.
Slice Definition:

The itemsSlice is created using createSlice, which takes an object with three main properties:
name: Identifies the slice as 'items'.
initialState: Sets the initial state to DEFAULT_ITEMS, which includes predefined items with attributes such as id, image, company, item_name, etc.
reducers: An object containing reducer functions that manage state changes. In this case:
addInitialItems: A reducer that replaces the current state with action.payload, effectively resetting the items to a new list. This payload is expected to be an array of item objects.
Exporting Actions and Reducer:

itemsActions: Exports the actions generated by the slice (in this case, only addInitialItems) for use in dispatching actions throughout the application.
The default export of itemsSlice provides access to the slice's reducer, which can be integrated into the Redux store.
Technicalities:
State Management: By using Redux Toolkit, this slice adheres to best practices for state management, promoting maintainability and readability.
Immutability: The reducer directly returns a new state rather than mutating the existing state, following Redux’s principles of immutability.
Scalability: The structure allows for easy addition of more reducers in the future to handle other actions related to items (e.g., updating, deleting items).
