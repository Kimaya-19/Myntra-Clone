Technical Description of bagSlice.js
This file utilizes Redux Toolkit to create a slice of the Redux state specifically for managing a shopping bag in an e-commerce application.

Key Components:
Importing Dependencies:

The createSlice function from the @reduxjs/toolkit is imported to simplify the process of creating the slice.
Slice Definition:

The bagSlice is created using createSlice, with the following properties:
name: Identifies the slice as "bag".
initialState: Initializes the state as an empty array, representing the bag's contents.
Reducers:

addToBag:
Accepts an action containing the item to be added.
Checks if the item already exists in the bag using its id. If it does not exist, the item is added to the state.
removeFromBag:
Accepts an action containing the id of the item to be removed.
Returns a new state array, filtering out the specified item.
Exported Elements:

bagActions: Exports the actions generated by the slice for use in components (e.g., addToBag, removeFromBag).
Default Export: The slice itself is exported as the default export, providing access to the reducer for store configuration.
Usage Context:
The bagSlice is designed to manage the contents of a shopping bag, allowing users to add items without duplicates and remove items by their ID. It enhances maintainability and readability by encapsulating related logic and state management in a single module.
