The provided code snippet is a React functional component named Beauty, which fetches data from an API and manages the state of items to be displayed in a shopping cart (or similar application). Here’s a breakdown of the main logic behind fetching and adding data to the cart:

1. State Management with Redux
State Selectors:

fetchStatus: This state indicates whether the data fetching process has been completed.
items: This state holds the items fetched from the API or the default items if the fetch fails.
Dispatching Actions:

dispatch: This function is used to send actions to the Redux store, which triggers updates to the state based on the defined reducers.
2. Using useEffect for Data Fetching
The useEffect hook is used to handle side effects in the component, specifically for fetching data from an external API when the component mounts.
Main Logic Inside useEffect:
Early Exit:

The effect checks if fetching has already been completed (fetchStatus.fetchDone). If so, it exits early to prevent redundant fetch operations.
Fetch Request:

An AbortController is created to manage the fetch request. This allows the request to be aborted if the component unmounts before it completes.
Dispatching Fetch Status:

dispatch(fetchStatusActions.markFetchingStarted()): This action indicates that the fetching process has started.
Fetching Data:

A fetch request is made to the API endpoint (http://localhost:8080/beauty). The signal from the AbortController is passed to enable aborting the request if necessary.
Handling Response:

The response is checked for success (res.ok). If the response is not okay, an error is thrown.
If successful, the JSON data is extracted, which contains the items array.
Adding Items to State:

dispatch(itemsActions.addInitialItems(items)): This action is dispatched to add the fetched items to the Redux store, updating the items state.
Marking Fetch Status:

Once the data is fetched successfully, dispatch(fetchStatusActions.markFetchDone()) is called to update the fetch status.
Error Handling:

If there’s an error during the fetch (like a network issue), the default items (DEFAULT_ITEMS) are added to the state using dispatch(itemsActions.addInitialItems(DEFAULT_ITEMS)).
Cleanup:

The finally block calls dispatch(fetchStatusActions.markFetchingFinished()) to signal that the fetch process has completed, whether successfully or not.
The cleanup function returned by useEffect aborts the fetch request if the component is unmounted before the request completes.
3. Rendering the Component
The component renders a container for the items.
If items are available (items.length > 0), it maps over them and renders an ItemCard component for each item.
If no items are available, it displays a message indicating that no items are present.
Summary of Logic
Overall, the Beauty component demonstrates an effective way to fetch and manage data in a React application using Redux Toolkit for state management. It ensures that:

Data is fetched only once per component lifecycle unless explicitly reset.
Fallback to default data is handled gracefully in case of fetch failures.
The UI is updated in response to the changes in state managed by Redux.
